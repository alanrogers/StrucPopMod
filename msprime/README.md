# Simulations in Msprime

Each directory will contain simulations under a different model:

* `island`: simulations under the island model

* `torus`: simulations under a model of isolation by distance on a
  torus.

* `circle`: simulations under the circular stepping-stone model

* `xcircle`: circular stepping stone with extinction

* `xisland`: island model with extinction

2024-07-17: Only xisland and xcircle are used in the current version
of the manuscript.
