# Simulations under the island model of population structure

The number of demes is a finite number, *d*. Each lineage migrates at
rate *m* per generation in backwards continuous time. For a pair of
lineages, the combined rate is *2m* per generation or *M = 4Nm* per
unit of *2N* generations. When a migration occurs, the affected
lineage is equally likely to end up in any of the *d-1* other demes.

Each subdirectory has the analysis for a different value of *M*.
